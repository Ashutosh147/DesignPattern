üß© Problem Statement
When a product is out of stock on Amazon, users can click a "Notify Me" button to get notified once the product is back in stock.

Design a system where:

Users can subscribe to a product.

When the product is restocked, all subscribed users are notified.

Use the Observer Design Pattern to implement the solution.

üß† Design Pattern: Observer
Subject (Product): Keeps track of observers and notifies them of state changes (stock availability).

Observer (User): Wants to be notified when the subject changes.

üèóÔ∏è Classes Overview
Class	Role
User	Observer who wants to be notified
Product	Subject being observed

‚úÖ 1. Clarify the Requirements
Start by asking questions to remove ambiguity:

"Before jumping in, let me confirm the requirements."

Users can subscribe to get notified when a product is out of stock.

Once the product is back in stock, notify all subscribed users.

Notifications are one-way (no need for real-time chat).

Should users be notified only once or every time the product is restocked?

Do we need to persist subscriptions (e.g., DB), or is in-memory okay for now?

Interviewer might say:

‚ÄúIn-memory is fine for now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly notify once per restock.‚Äù

‚úÖ 2. High-Level Design / Core Components
Explain the key objects you‚Äôll need:

a. Product (Subject):
Holds state (e.g., in stock / out of stock).

Has a list of subscribed users.

Notifies them when the state changes to in-stock.

b. User (Observer):
Can subscribe to products.

Gets notified when the product is restocked.

c. Relationship:
"This is a classic case of the Observer Design Pattern."

Subject ‚Üí Notifies observers when a state change occurs.

Observers ‚Üí React when notified (e.g., show message, send email).

‚úÖ 3. Why Observer Pattern?
"Observer pattern is ideal here because:"

We want to decouple the Product from the notification logic.

New users can subscribe/unsubscribe without changing the Product code.

It allows for scalability (adding other observers like Email/SMS later).

‚úÖ 4. Low-Level Design (LLD)
‚ÄúLet me describe the classes I‚Äôd use.‚Äù

üß± Observer (Interface)
Method: update(product_name)

üë§ User implements Observer
Properties: name

Method: update prints or sends a notification.

üì¶ Subject (Interface)
Methods: register_observer, remove_observer, notify_observers

üì¶ Product implements Subject
Properties: name, in_stock, observers[]

Methods:

register_observer(user)

remove_observer(user)

set_stock_status(in_stock: bool)

notify_observers()

‚úÖ 5. Sample Workflow
Explain this flow clearly:

Product is out of stock.

Users subscribe to it.

Product is updated as in-stock.

All observers (users) are notified via update() method.
